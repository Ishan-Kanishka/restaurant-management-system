- Do your coding in feature branch
```
git add .
git commit -m "Implemented Promotion entity and repository"
git push origin feature/promotion
```

- Merge your feature into develop (like teamwork)

- Go to GitHub â†’ Open a Pull Request â†’ feature/promotion â†’ develop.

- Review yourself (pretend youâ€™re the teammate ðŸ˜…) â†’ Merge.

- After testing in develop â†’ merge into main

- Open a PR: develop â†’ main.

- Merge only when stable.

ðŸ‘‰ This way, youâ€™ll train yourself in real-world workflow: feature â†’ develop â†’ main.
